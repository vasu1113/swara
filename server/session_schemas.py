"""Live voice-session protocol.

Mirrors `extension/src/types/session.ts` — change both together.

One WebSocket carries JSON control messages both ways plus base64 audio, so a
chunk can never overtake the state change that explains it.

Audio in is base64 Int16 PCM at 16 kHz. Sarvam's streaming STT accepts
wav / pcm_s16le / pcm_l16 / pcm_raw only — webm/opus is rejected, so the client
captures raw PCM via AudioWorklet rather than MediaRecorder.
